# Model Details

## Overview
The melanoma detection model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) ensemble approach, combining the strengths of multiple architectures to achieve high classification accuracy. This ensemble model aims to improve sensitivity in detecting malignant melanoma, reducing the likelihood of false negatives.

## Model Architecture
The model ensemble consists of the following CNN architectures:
1. **EfficientNet**: Known for its efficiency and accuracy, EfficientNet uses compound scaling to achieve state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.
2. **ResNet50**: A deep residual network that uses skip connections to overcome vanishing gradients, making it effective for image classification tasks.
3. **MobileNetV2**: A lightweight CNN architecture designed for efficient performance on mobile and embedded devices, also achieving robust classification accuracy.

These models are pre-trained on large image datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and fine-tuned on the melanoma detection dataset for enhanced performance.

### Model Ensemble Strategy
The ensemble model combines predictions from the individual CNN architectures. The final prediction is generated by averaging the probabilities from each model, providing a more stable and accurate classification.

## Hyperparameters
Each model in the ensemble was fine-tuned using the following key hyperparameters:
- **Learning Rate**: 1e-4 (adjusted based on the model type)
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Epochs**: 20 (early stopping applied to prevent overfitting)
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer with a learning rate scheduler to dynamically adjust learning rates during training.

Additional hyperparameters specific to each CNN architecture (e.g., number of layers, feature map sizes) were retained from their pre-trained configurations.

## Training Process
The training process involves fine-tuning each pre-trained model on the melanoma detection dataset, as follows:
1. **Data Augmentation**: Extensive data augmentation is applied to increase the variety of training samples, helping prevent overfitting.
2. **Transfer Learning**: The CNN models are pre-trained on ImageNet and further fine-tuned on the melanoma dataset to learn domain-specific features.
3. **Early Stopping**: The training process monitors validation loss, applying early stopping when no improvement is observed for a specified number of epochs.
4. **Ensemble Prediction**: After individual training, the models are used in ensemble mode to make final predictions by averaging their probability outputs.

### Loss Function
- **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss**: Suitable for binary classification tasks, this loss function calculates the difference between predicted probabilities and the true labels, guiding the model towards accurate predictions.

## Evaluation Metrics
The ensemble model is evaluated on various metrics to assess its performance comprehensively:

- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correct predictions (both benign and malignant).
- **Precision**: Indicates the accuracy of malignant predictions, showing how many predicted malignant cases are truly malignant.
- **Recall**: Assesses the modelâ€™s ability to identify malignant cases, critical for minimizing false negatives.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced metric for imbalanced classes.

## Model Performance Summary
| Metric     | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Accuracy   | 89%   |
| Precision  | 87%   |
| Recall     | 85%   |
| F1-Score   | 86%   |

These metrics confirm that the ensemble model effectively identifies malignant cases while balancing false positives and false negatives.

## Deployment
The final model is packaged for deployment with the following tool:
- **Gradio** for a user-friendly web interface allowing users to upload images and receive real-time predictions.
